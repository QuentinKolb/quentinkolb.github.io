            <h2>White Space: </h2>
            <p>Amazon</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Amazon does a great job by showing people how to utilize their white space by maximizing the number
                    of products they have to sale. There aren't just one or two cozy slippers, rather, a different variety to help
                    customers get an idea of what style they might like. </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Rule of Thirds: </h2>
            <p>National Geographic</p>
            <a class="amazon" href="https://nationalgeographic.com" target="_blank">https://nationalgeographic.com</a>
            <img class="picture" src="images/nationalgeographictwo.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of National Geographic">
            <ul>
                <li>National Geographic shows rules of thirds really well with the different pictures they've chosen. The two men riding the
                    bikes aren't directly in the center, rather off to the side. The fish are in the top left as well, letting the readers eyes absorb
                    everything in the picture without overwhelming them.

            <h2>Proximity: </h2>
            <p>Canon Cameras</p>
            <a href="https://shop.usa.canon.com" target="_blank">https://shop.usa.canon.com</a>
            <img class="picture" src="images/canoncameras.jpeg" alt="Screenshot of Canon cameras">
            <ul>
                <li>This website shows proximity through the placement of their cameras. Because the items are grouped together in an organized way, and they
                    are close to one another, we consider them all part of one group. If they were spread out evenly, we
                    wouldn't know where one stopped and the next started.  </li>
            </ul>
