            <ul>
                <li>This website shows proximity. Because the items are grouped together in an organized way, and they
                are close to one another, we consider them all part of one group. If they were spread out evenly, we
                wouldn't know where one stopped and the next started. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>This shows Hick's law pretty well. It only gives one option - Learn more. This minimizes the amount
                    of time people have to think about what they want. If they are on their website, they probably want
                    to learn more and that option is provided. </li>
