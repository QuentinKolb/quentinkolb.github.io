            <ul>
                <li>This website shows proximity. Because the items are grouped together in an organized way, and they
                are close to one another, we consider them all part of one group. If they were spread out evenly, we
                wouldn't know where one stopped and the next started. </li>

            <ul>
                <li>This shows proximity really well because the "Today's Picks" articles are all grouped close together showing their relation
                    with one another. I wish I could show above the articles as well because National Geographic has another section called "Latest Stories"
                    that allows users to quickly choose different articles.  </li>
