        <h1>Typography</h1>
        <p>I wanted to use Tinos as my font because it's something that's noticeably different, but doesn't distract the reader from what they're trying to learn.
            learn more about. Having the right font is really important because if it's too distracting, readers won't be very interested in trying to learn more. Having
            something simple to read is very convenient and will keep the readers' engaged.
