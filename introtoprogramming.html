        <h1>Sierra Shea Skin</h1>

        <p>Welcome to Sierra Shea Skin! My wife is becoming an esthetician and one day she will have her own website to help 
            clients get to know her! She is from Aztec, New Mexico, which is in the four corners area and loves animals.
            Helping people is really important to her because it brings her joy to watch people improve their skin. </p>
        <p>
            She would offer a variety of services to her clients and help them come up with routines to accomplish their skin. Drinking
            water is one of the most important things we can do and wearing sunscreen helps prevent dark spots and wrinkles
            which we may not always see. She'll recommend products that are best to help the type of skin you have. If you fill out your name and email below,
            she'll email you to set up a consultation!
        </p>
